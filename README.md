# mTBI-EEG

Pipeline for the processing and analysis of EEG data from mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI) patients.

The processing pipeline reads raw EEG data and processes it to obtain bandpower data.
The analysis pipeline utilizes ML models for classifying the subjects. 
The preprocessing and analysis sections are run separately.

## Experiments - Pytorch Neural Network

The `experiments/` directory contains standalone Jupyter notebooks as an intended new feature of the main pipeline.

The file `torch_mlp_nn.ipynb` describes the implementation of MLP on EEG bandpower features. This is a 2-layer neural network classifier using PyTorch, applied to MNE's public `eegbci` dataset (motor-imagery EEG from PhysioNet, 20 subjects). 

## Folder structure
The folder structure for the project is shown below. The root folder is `mtbi_meeg`. The code is under `src`. Common scripts and config files are under `src/`.
The modules for data processing and data analysis are under `src/processing/` and `src/analysis/`.

## Installing the package locally in the computer
The package can be installed by cloning the repository and using pip install:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BioMag/mtbi_meeg
$ cd mtbi_meeg
$ python3 -m pip install -e .
```
The `-e` flag installs the package in editable mode, so your changes to `src/` take effect immediately without reinstalling.

If installing dependencies system-wide isn't possible or desirable, use the conda or Docker setup below instead.

## Installing in a Conda environment

### Installing miniconda (macOS)
If you don't have conda yet, install miniconda via Homebrew:
```bash
$ brew install --cask miniconda
```
Then initialize it for your shell (one-time setup) and restart your terminal:
```bash
$ conda init "$(basename "${SHELL}")"   # e.g. conda init zsh
```
Verify with `conda --version`.

### Installing miniconda (windows)
Download from https://www.anaconda.com/download/success

### Installign miniconda (Linux)
Follow instructions from https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install/linux-install

### Creating the environment
1. After cloning the repository, navigate to the root directory.
2. Create the conda environment by running,
    ```
    $ conda env create --file environment.yml
    # Note: this step might take 20+ minutes
    ```
3. Activate the created environment,
    ```
    $ conda activate mtbi_meeg_conda
    ```
   If `conda activate` errors with "shell has not been properly configured", run `conda init zsh` (or `bash`) and restart your terminal.
4. Install the package and its dependencies,
    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install -e .
    ```
## Installing using Docker
The Dockerfile is based on `continuumio/miniconda3:latest` and installs the conda env from `environment.yml` (via mamba for speed), then `pip install -e .` for the package itself. Inside the container, the `mtbi_meeg_conda` env is activated by default.

1. Build the image: `docker build -t mtbi_meeg .`
2. Run the container: `docker run -it mtbi_meeg`

> **Caveats from real-world testing on macOS + colima:**
> - The build needs at least **8 GB** of VM memory. With colima: `colima stop && colima start --memory 8`.
> - The first build takes ~10 minutes (mamba env creation dominates).

## Getting started: config_common and check_system

Before the first time you execute the scripts in this repository, you must edit `src/config_common.py` and add a new block with information about your user, workstation, data directories, and matplotlib backend:

1. Open `src/config_common.py` and add a new `elif` block for your machine, using this template:

    ```python
    elif host == '<WORKSTATION>' and user == '<USER>' :
        # <USER>'s workstation in <WORKPLACE>
        raw_data_dir = ''
        processed_data_dir = ''
        reports_dir = ''
        figures_dir = ''
        n_jobs = 4
        matplotlib_backend = ''
    ```
2. Set `raw_data_dir` ('/net/theta/fishpool/projects/tbi_meg/BIDS' in BioMag).
3. Set `processed_data_dir` (be mindful which folder you choose, as you may overwrite other people's data).
4. Set `reports_dir` and `figures_dir` (you can use the directories in this repository or other).
5. Set `matplotlib_backend` (use `Qt5Agg` for desktop, `Agg` for headless/HPC).
6. Verify dependencies: `python3 check_system.py`. On success you'll see `System requirements are ok`.

### Version Conflict errors
If there is an issue with packages or versions, you will see a message indicating the library with a Version Conflict. Please update the package
```bash
# For updating using pip,
$ python3 -m  pip install --upgrade <package-name>
# For updating using conda,
$ conda update <package-name>
```
### Missing raw data dir errors
 If raw data is missing, the repository cannot be used.

## Running the pipelines
Once you have added the required information in config_common and checked that all the dependencies are met, you can run the `preprocessing` or `analysis` sections. If you haven't, please follow the instructions described above.

### Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline can be found in `src/processing/`. The aim of this pipeline is to clean up the data and extract useful features, so data can be used by the classifiers in the analysis section.

**Files:**
- `01_freqfilt.py`: applies frequency filtering
- `02_ica.py`: removes ocular & heartbeat artefacts with independent component analysis
- `03_psds.py`: computes the PSDs over all channels and saves them as h5 files
- `04_bandpower.py`: calculates band power for each subject and creates a spatial frequency matrix that is then vectorized for later analysis.

**Inputs:**
- Raw data (in folder `raw_data_dir`)
- Parameters defined in config_eeg.py 
- Subject(s)

**Outputs:**
- Processed files: CSV files with bandpower data (in folder `processed_data_dir`)
- Reports

#### How to run
Go to the folder `src/processing`. Make sure that file `subjects.txt` exists in the folder.

You can run one file at a time using `python3 <filename> <arguments>`.
Alternatively, you can run the pipeline using the `run_files.py` file. This means that it will re-run the pipeline as many times as subjects there are.
Since running all the steps for one subject might take a couple of minutes, there's an option to run a test run with only two subjects by modifying the boolean `TEST_RUN` to True in the `run_files.py` file.

```bash
$ cd src/processing/
# Note: Due to the extensive time that running the processing pipeline for each subject takes,
# one can modify the boolean `TEST_RUN` to True in the file `run_files.py` (using, e.g., `nano run_files.py`).
# This will run the whole processing pipeline for only 2 subjects, which takes around 3min or 1.5min per subject.
$ python3 run_files.py
```

### Analysis pipeline
The data analysis is done using the scripts in the folder `src/analysis`. The aim is to use different classifiers (LR, LDA, SVM and RF) to differentiate between patients and controls. A file `subjects.txt` is expected in this folder.

**Files:**
- `01_read_processed_data.py`: Reads in EEG bandpower data from CSV files into a dataframe. The dataframe and the arguments used to run the script are added to a pickle object.
- `02_plot_processed_data.py`: (optional step) Plots the processed EEG data of the PSD intensity for visual assessment.
- `03_fit_classifier_and_plot.py`: Fits ML classifiers using the processed data, performs cross validation and evaluates the performance of the classification using ROC curves. Outputs a CSV file with the classification results, plots and saves plots to disk and adds the information to a metadata file.
- `03_psd_topoplots.py`: (WIP) Plots PSD topographic maps across channels.
- `04_create_report.py`: (optional) Creates an HTML report with the figures created in step 03.
- `05_reports_to_pdf.py`: (optional) Bundle up all htmls into one with a certain cover and create a PDF from it.
- `run_files.py`: Orchestrates the analysis pipeline by running steps 01–05 sequentially for each task (EO, EC, PASAT_1, PASAT_2).

**Inputs:**
- Processed files: CSV files with bandpower data (in folder `processed_data_dir`)
- List of subjects in `subjects.txt`
- parameters defined in `config_eeg.py`

**Outputs:**
- CSV file with results from ML classification accuracy metrics
- PNG figures
- HTML reports
- PDF with all the HTML reports

#### How to run it
Go to the folder `src/analysis`. Make sure that file `subjects.txt` exists in the folder.

You can run one file at a time using `python3 <filename> <arguments>`.
Alternatively, you can run the whole pipeline using the `run_files.py` file. It loops over all steps of the pipeline, using all the list of subjects for each steps, but iterating over the four different tasks: eyes open (EO), eyes closed (EC), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test 1 or 2 (PASAT_1 or PASAT_2). This means that you will run the whole pipeline four times. 

```bash
$ cd src/analysis/
# Note: Make sure that subjects.txt exists here
$ python3 run_files.py
```

### Subjects as arguments
Subjects can be passed either as command-line arguments to individual scripts, or listed in `subjects.txt` (used by `run_files.py`). Example `subjects.txt`:

```python
01C
01P
02C
02P
# etc
```
